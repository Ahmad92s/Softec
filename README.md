(I tried cutting it to 4 minutes, but filmora suprised me with a huge watermark and windows editor refuses to save changes, so please accept the 5 minute version)

The game follows the story of a samurai video game character from 1989 who makes a return to the modern world, 100 years later. 
It was decided to take a narrative based approach towards the theme of the game jam, which is why I decided to go the extra mile for cutscenes. 

>Gameplay
>>The game primarily follows a hitbox based hack and slash gameplay inspired by Batman arkham series' combat and the Yakuza series.

>Player Behavior
>>The player controller is rigidbody based.
>>The player is given fast paced traversal mechanics with quick movements.
>>The player is allowed to walk, run, jump and dodge. Dodging and jumping covers a large distance, giving the player advantage against a swarm of enemies.
>>Along with that, there are several combos to play with, and a running attack. Players can do a standing combo, a directional combo, and anything they choose to mix and match with.


>Enemy Behavior
>>There are 2 types of enemies. The melee attackers with swords, and ranged attacker with laser guns.
>>In a game like this, it is important to design it in such a way that the player does not feel like being cheated against. To do this, I added a long build up animation for melee soldiers' attacks and a laser aim color change for ranged attackers.
>>The lasers turn red just when the enemmy is about to shoot, allowing them to dodge in time.


>Boss Battle
>>The boss has been given a special move and a shield.
>>He will cover himself with a force field temporarily to become invincible. Also allowing him to attack without being at risk.
>>He opens up small windows of vulnerability which the player needs to take advantage of.
>>His attacks and special moves follow the same formula as the normal enemies. The graphics for special move allow the player a anticipate and make a decision to dodge accordingly.


>Environment Design
>>The environment was designed using emission maps and bloom to make the environment glow.
>>The color palette mostly consists for light blue, light pink and golden to give the retro future vibe.
>>Some buildings even have pixel art lit up on their surface.

>Sound Design
>>The sounds were given special attention in order to achieve a good production qualaity
